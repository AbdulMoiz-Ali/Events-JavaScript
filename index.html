      <p class="ali">
        A good website is a responsive website. The user does something—clicks a button, <br>
moves the mouse, presses a key—and something happens. JavaScript gives you many ways to<br>
respond to the user's needs. A few examples:<br>
The user clicks a button saying "Our Guarantee" and an alert displays spelling out the<br>
guarantee.<br>
A page displays a "before" picture of a model. When the user mouses over the picture, it<br>
is replaced by an "after" picture of her.<br>
The user types a number in the Ounces field on a form. When she clicks in the Grams<br>
field, the equivalent in grams displays.<br>
The user has entered her email address in a form, and is about to type a comment. When<br>
she moves the cursor from the email field to the comment field, JavaScript checks to see if the<br>
email address is valid. In this case, it isn't—she's omitted ".com" at the end of the address. A<br>
message displays letting her know that she's entered an invalid email address.<br>
On an online shopping site, there's a picture of a black watch. Next to it is a drop-down<br>
list asking the user to choose a color. When she chooses, the color of the watch in the picture<br>
changes to that color.<br>
All of these user actions—clicking a button, moving the mouse, moving from one field to<br>
another in a form, selecting a different option—are known as events. JavaScript code that<br>
responds to an event—for example, displaying a guarantee or swapping an image when the<br>
pointer hovers over it—is called an event handler.<br>
In this chapter and the ones that immediately follow, you'll learn the oldest and most<br>
straightforward approach to event-handling—inline event-handling. When you're writing<br>
production code, this is not the best way to handle events, for the same reason that inline CSS<br>
styling isn't the best way to format HTML elements. But since it's the least abstract way to do<br>
it, it's the easiest to learn, and can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced methods. Later<br>
in the book, you'll learn the approach that's preferred by most professionals—the scripting<br>
approach. <br>
Inline event-handling means that you combine bits of JavaScript with HTML markup. <br>
Here's a line that displays a link and then displays an alert when the user clicks it.<br>
< a href="#" onClick="alert('Hi');">Click< /a><br>
As an HTML coder, you're familiar with the beginning and end of this markup, < a href=<br>
and >Click</a><br>
But when the user clicks this link, it behaves differently than normal hyperlinks. Instead of<br>
taking the user to another page, or to a named anchor on the same page, it displays an alert<br>
saying "Hi".<br>
When the user clicks the link, it goes nowhere, and instead executes a JavaScript<br>
statement, in this case calling a function.<br>
Let's break it down.<br>
When the user clicks the link, you don't want a new webpage to be loaded in this case, so,<br>
instead of a URL, you place a # inside the quotation marks. This tells the browser to<br>
reload the current page.<br>
onClick= says, "When the button is clicked, execute the following JavaScript." onClick<br>
isn't case-sensitive. You could write onclick, ONCLICK, or OnClIcK and it would work.<br>
But the convention is onClick, so we'll stick with that.<br>
A JavaScript statement (or more than one), enclosed in quotes, follows. When the user<br>
clicks the link, it executes.<br>
One more thing to notice: onClick="alert('Hi');" The message inside the parens is<br>
surrounded by single quotes, not the double quotes we've been using for an alert string. In<br>
JavaScript code, you aren't allowed to nest double quotes within double quotes or single<br>
quotes within single quotess. Since the entire JavaScript statement is enclosed in double<br>
quotes, you have to enclose the alert message in single quotes.<br>
But there's a problem with the markup above. < a href="#" tells the browser to reload<br>
the page. This means that if the user has scrolled down to the link, the click, in addition t<br>o
running the JavaScript code, will scroll the page back to the top—an action you don't normall<br>y
want. I've included this flawed approach, using < a href="#", because you'll run into here and <br>
there in other people's work, but you'll probably prefer this approach:<br>
< a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('Hi');">Click< /a><br>
Now you've got exactly what you want. Nothing at all happens except for the JavaScript<br>
that executes.<br>
In the example above, the click executes only a single JavaScript statement. But there is<br>
no limit to the number of JavaScript statements that you can enclose in the quotation marks. <br>No
limit, that is, except for common sense. As you'll see, there are better ways to trigger<br>
JavaScript than packing multiple statements into an online onClick event. But let me show you<br>
the principle, with this example. When the user clicks, a first statement assigns 'hi' to a<br>
variable and a second statement displays an alert specifying the variable as the message.<br>
<b>< a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="var greet"hi'; alert(greet);">Click< /a ></b><br>
As I've said, coding professionals frown on inline JavaScript. But if you do use this<br>
approach, it's more craftsmanlike to call a function.<br>
Here's a function.<br>
1 function popup(message) {<br>
2 alert(message);<br>
3 }<br>
This is the event-handler that calls the function.<br>
< a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="popup('Hi');">Click< /a><br>
When the user clicks the link, the event-handler calls the function, passing the argument<br>
'Hi' to it. The function displays an alert saying 'Hi'.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Events: button :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        In the last chapter you learned how to repurpose a link to make it trigger an event when <br>
it's clicked, instead of loading a new page. You learned to do it with inline event-handling, not<br>
the best way, but the easiest to learn. Later in the book, you'll learn the approach that's<br>
preferred by most professionals—the scripting approach.<br>
But even if you're using the inline method, when you want to give the user something to<br>
click, a more professional approach, usually, is to use a button rather than a link.<br>
Suppose that when the user clicks a button, an alert displays saying, "Hello world!"<br>
Here's the code.<br>
< input type="button" value="Click" onClick="alert('Hello world!');"><br>
The event handler is the same, whether you're coding a link or a button:<br>
onClick="alert('Hello world!');"<br>
But the beginning of the code is different: < input type="button" value="Click"<br>
Some pros would argue that the button code should be enclosed in form tags, but it's not<br>
absolutely necessary. And anyway, since we're already violating best practices by using inline<br>
event handlers, why not scandalize the pros with multiple violations? (You'll learn more<br>
respectable alternatives to inline event handlers later in the book.)<br>
As an HTML coder you know that you can use an image as a hot link. The markup would<br>
look something like this.<br>
< a href="summary-page.html">< img src="button-sum-pg.png">< /a><br>
You can also use an image to trigger an event. Let's say that when the user clicks an<br>
image, an alert pops up. This is the code. Note that the code for the inline event handler is the<br>
same as before.<br>
< img src="button-greet.png" onClick="alert('Hello world!');"><br>
Or, if you want to be more professional about it, you could have the event trigger a<br>
function.<br>
< img src="button-greet.png" onClick="greetTheUser();"><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Events: mouse :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        You've learned how to make things happen when the user clicks a link, a button, or an <br>
image, by using inline event-handling. Inline event handling isn't the best approach, but the <br>
easiest to learn. Later in the book, you'll learn the approach that's preferred by most <br>
professionals—the scripting approach. <br>
But whether you're using the inline method or the preferred scripting method, the onClick <br>
event is only one of many kinds of events that your code can respond to. In this chapter, you <br>'ll
learn how to make things happen when the user mouses over something on the page, and also <br>
when the user mouses away from it. <br>
Suppose your page initially displays a "before" picture of a model. When the user mouses <br>
over the picture, it is replaced by an "after" picture. You might prefer to do this with CSS, <br> but
since this is a JavaScript book, I'll show you how to do it with an event handler. <br>
This is the markup that replaces the before picture with the after picture. <br>
< img src="before-pic.jpg" onMouseover="src='after-pic.jpg'"> <br>
It begins as a plain vanilla image tag: < img src="before-pic.jpg" <br>
Then comes the event-handling keyword. The keyword is in camelCase—optional but <br>
widely used: onMouseover <br>
An equal sign follows the keyword onMouseover, just as it does with onClick. Then <br>
comes the response to the event, which is in quotes: "src='after-pic.jpg'"> <br>
You may be surprised that the response to the event isn't written in JavaScript. It's HTML <br>
markup. <br>
Note: The image source must be enclosed in single quotes, because of those double <br>
quotes that enclose the whole phrase. <br>
You can use onMouseover event handling with other HTML elements, too. Here's a bit of <br>
inline code that displays an alert when a heading is moused over. <br>
< h1 onMouseover="alert('Be sure to get your shopping done today.');">World Ends Tomorrow< /h <br>1>
When the user mouses over the head, an alert displays. <br>
In the example above, you might prefer to call a function that displays the alert rather than <br>
code the alert inline. <br>
Here's a JavaScript alternative to the preferred CSS color-change on hover. <br>
< a href="index.html" onMouseover="this.style.color='green';">Home Page< /a> <br>
When the user mouses over the link, it turns green. <br>
At this point don't be concerned about the overall idea behind this.style.color in the <br>
151 <br>
example. For now, just memorize the sequence so you can repeat it in the exercises. <br>
In the next example, the paragraph expands to include more information when the user <br>
hovers over it. <br>
< p id="loris" onMouseover="expand();">Slow Loris: Mouse over for more info< /p> <br>
At this point don't worry now about how the function expand grows the paragraph. You'll <br>
learn about that later. <br>
In the example we started with, the model's before-and-after pictures, the onMouseover <br>
event handler replaces the "before" picture with the "after" picture when the user mouses ove <br>r
the image. Normally, you'd want the image to revert to the original when the user mouses away <br>
from the picture. So you'd combine the onMouseover event handler with the onMouseout event <br>
handler. <br>
< img src="before-pic.jpg" onMouseover="src='after-pic.jpg'" <br>
onMouseout="src='before-pic.jpg'"> <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Events: fields :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Let's say you have a text field for the user's email address. When the user clicks in the <br>
field to type her entry, the field turns yellow. <br>
This is the markup that makes it happen. <br>
Email:<br>
< input type="text" size="30" onFocus="this.style.backgroundColor='yellow';"> <br>
Once again, I'm showing you the not-recommended inline way to handle an event, using it <br>
as a stepping stone for learning more professional event-handling later in the book. Again, I'm <br>
not explaining this.style.backgroundColor. Just memorize the sequence to use in the <br>
exercises. <br>
The keyword here is onFocus. It tells JavaScript to do something when the user clicks in <br>
the field. <br>
The syntax is the same as for other event handlers that you've already learned to code: a <br>
keyword, followed by an equal sign, followed by JavaScript or HTML in quotes. <br>
After the user enters her email address—or not—and clicks outside the field or presses <br>
the tab key to move to another field—that is, when this field no longer has the focus—you want <br>
it to revert to a white background. You do this with the onBlur keyword, which is the opposite <br>
of onFocus. <br>
This markup handles both the onFocus and the onBlur events. <br>
Email:<br>
< input type="text" size="30" onFocus="this.style.backgroundColor='yellow';" <br>
onBlur="this.style.backgroundColor='white';"> <br> <br>
When the user clicks into the field, it turns yellow. When she clicks out of the field, it <br>
reverts to white. <br>
A slightly more professional approach would be to call functions that accomplish the <br>
same things. <br>
Email:<br>
< input type="text" size="30" onFocus="makeFieldYellow();" onBlur="makeFieldWhite();"> <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Reading field values :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Suppose you've included an email field in a form, and you've made it a required field. <br>
The form has a submit button that the user clicks to submit the information that he's entered in <br>
the form. <br>
This is the markup that creates the form. I've simplified it, omitting any form action and <br>
other attributes, including linebreaks, that don't bear on what you're learning here. <br>
< form> <br>
Email: <br>
< input type="text"> <br>
< input type="submit" value="Submit"> <br>
< /form> <br>
So now in our stripped-down form markup, we've got these three elements: <br>
1. The text "Email" <br>
2. The text field for the user's email address <br>
3. The submit button <br>
I'm going to give the email field an id. <br>
< form> <br>
Email: <br>
< input type="text" id="email"> <br>
< input type="submit" value="Submit"> <br>
< /form> <br>
Next, I'm going to add an event-handler, using the keyword onSubmit. <br>
< form onSubmit="checkAddress('email');"> <br>
Email: <br>
< input type="text" id="email"> <br>
< input type="submit" value="Submit"> <br>
< /form> <br>
Now, when the user clicks the submit button, the function checkAddress executes. Note <br>
that, even though the action is a click on the submit button, the onSubmit event handler is in <br>
the form tag, not in the submit button tag. That's because the submission is an event that <br>
applies to the whole form, not the submit button. <br>
Here's where things get interesting. When the form is submitted, the function <br>
checkAddress looks to see if the user has entered anything in the email field. If not, the <br>
function displays an alert reminding the user that the email address is required. <br>
In order to do this, the function needs a way to read what's in the email field. This is <br>
where the id that I added to the field comes in. Here's the code for the function. <br>
1 function checkAddress(fieldId) { <br>
2 if (document.getElementById(fieldId).value === "") { <br>
3 alert("Email address required."); <br>
4 } <br>
5 } <br>
If there's no value in the email field, an alert displays telling the user that an email <br>
address is required. <br>
This is the sequence you need to memorize: <br>
1. The keyword document, followed by... <br>
2. a dot, followed by... <br>
3. the keyword getElementById, followed by... <br>
4. the parameter, in parens, received from the calling code, fieldId,followed by... <br>
5. another dot, followed by... <br>
6. the keyword value <br>
Note that getElementById must be in strict camelCase. If you do what comes naturally <br>
and write getElementByID, with a cap "D," it won't work. <br>
Some coders prefer to put the value found in the field into a variable, like this. <br>
1 function checkAddress(fieldId) { <br>
2 var val = document.getElementById(fieldId).value; <br>
3 if val === "") { <br>
4 alert("Email address required."); <br>
5 } <br>
6 } <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Setting field values :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        The user has entered her ZIP code in a form field. You want to save her the trouble of
entering the city and state. So when she clicks out of the field, you fill in the city field for her.
Let me show you how to do that. To keep things simple, we'll pretend there are only three
ZIP codes in the U.S. We'll also pretend that the user will infallibly enter one of these codes.
We won't check for errors. And for this example, the JavaScript code will fill in only the city
field, not the state. Here's the relevant markup for the form. (I'm omitting a form action, a
submit button, and everything else that's not relevant to this chapter.)
< form>
ZIP:<br>
< input type="text" id="zip" onBlur="fillCity();"><br>
City:<br>
< input type="text" id="city">
< /form>
When the user clicks out of the ZIP field, the onBlur event triggers the fillCity  <br>
function. This is the code. <br>
1 function fillCity() { <br>
2 var cityName; <br>
3 var zipEntered = document.getElementById("zip").value; <br>
4 switch (zipEntered) { <br>
5 case "60608" : <br>
6 cityName = "Chicago"; <br>
7 break; <br>
8 case "68114" : <br>
9 cityName = "Omaha"; <br>
10 break; <br>
11 case "53212" : <br>
12 cityName = "Milwaukee"; <br>
13 } <br>
14 document.getElementById("city").value = cityName; <br>
15 } <br>
This example shows that you can not only read a value in a field with <br>
document.getElementById..., but can also "write" a value into a field. <br>
In this case, the function assigns the value found in the ZIP field to a variable.Then, using<br>
a switch statement, it matches the ZIP to a city name and assigns that name to a second <br>
variable. Then, using the variable, it places the city name in the city field. <br>

      <h1>-: Reading and setting paragraph text :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Your webpage initially displays a picture of a little mammal known as the slow loris, <br>
along with a single sentence: <br>
Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus <br>
Nycticebus. Click for more. <br>
When the user clicks the link, the paragraph expands: <br>
Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus <br>
Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration <br>
patterns that are species-dependent. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations <br>
that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow<br> 
lorises have a toxic bite, a rare trait among mammals. <br>
This is the markup. <br>
< p id="slowLoris"> <br>
Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus Nycticebus. <br>
< a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="expandLoris();">< em>Click for more.</ em>< /a> <br>
< /p> <br>
An id is assigned to the paragraph, which will be used by the function. When the user <br>
clicks the link, a function, expandLoris, is called. <br>
This is the function. <br>
1 function expandLoris() { <br>
2 var expandedParagraph = "Slow lorises are a group of several species of trepsirrhine primates which <br>
make up the genus Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of<br>

adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. <br>
Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a rare trait among mammals."; <br>
3 document.getElementById("slowLoris").innerHTML = expandedParagraph; <br>
4 } <br>
Line 2 assigns the long version of the text to a variable. Then, identifying the paragraph by <br>
its id, line 3 replaces the original content, the innerHTML, with the text stored in the variable. <br>
Almost anything, including HTML tags, can be inserted into the web page this way. For <br>
example, you could make this list appear on the page within, say, a div with the id "lorisList". <br>
1. Slow loris <br>
2. Fast loris <br>
3. Just-right loris <br>
This is the function that loads the list markup into the div, which has been given an id of <br>
"lorisList". <br>
161 <br>
1 function placeAList() { <br>
2 var listToPlace = "< ol>< li>Slow loris</ li>< li>Fast loris</ li>< li>Just-right loris</ li></ ol>"; <br>
3 document.getElementById("lorisList").innerHTML = listToPlace; <br>
4 } <br>
Line 2 assigns all the HTML for the list to a variable. Line 3 places the HTML into the <br>
div that has been assigned the id "lorisList". <br>
You can use document.getElementById(element id).innerHTML to read as well as <br>
"write" the contents of an element. For example, this function assigns whatever is in the <br>
paragraph, div, or other element with the id "content" to the variable whatsThere. <br>
1 function peekAtContent() { <br>
2 var whatsThere = document.getElementById("content").innerHTML; <br>
3 } <br>
Line 2 reads all the HTML within the element with an id of "content" and assigns it to the <br>
variable whatsThere. If the element is, for example, a paragraph whose content is " <br>
< em>Hello, Sailor!</ em>" the variable whatsThere captures "< em>Hello, Sailor!</ em>" <br>

      <h1>-: Manipulating images and text :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Your webpage displays a picture of a blobfish. The blobfish is a fascinating animal, but <br>
it's so ugly, some of your users go "Yuck." So you give them the option of making it disappear. <br>
When they click the image, it vanishes. <br>
You begin by giving the image an id. <br>
< img src="Blobfish.jpg" id="ugly"... <br>
Then you add an event handler. <br>
< img src="blobfish.jpg" id="ugly" onClick="makeInvisible();"> <br>
You have a CSS class for invisibility. <br>
.hidden {display:none;} <br>
The function called by the event handler gives the image a class of "hidden," so it <br>
disappears. <br>
1 function makeInvisible() { <br>
2 document.getElementById("ugly").className = "hidden"; <br>
3 } <br>
When the function is called, it assigns the "hidden" class to the element with the id "ugly." <br>
The image disappears. <br>
Some things to keep in mind: <br>
This is just a variation on things you've already learned, <br>
document.getElementById(theElementId).value (for form fields) and <br>
document.getElementById(theElementId).innerHTML (for paragraphs, divs, and <br>
other HTML elements). <br>
It's className, in camelCase, not class. <br>
Assigning a class to an element this way replaces any classes that the element has been <br>
assigned in the static markup. <br>
If you want to add a class to an element, preserving its existing classes, you can do it. For <br>
example, suppose you have a paragraph with a class that styles it in Verdana, size 1 em. When <br>
the user mouses over it, you want to double its size to 2 em. But you don't want to lose the <br>
Verdana styling of its original class. Rather than replace the class that styles it in Verdana,you  <br>
want to retain that class and add the class that enlarges the font. Let's say the element has the id <br>
"p1". This is the function. <br>
1 function makeBig() { <br>
2 document.getElementById("p1").className += " big"; <br>
3 } <br>
Compared with the code that replaces all the existing classes with a new one, this code <br>
has two small differences. <br>
It's += instead of just =. <br>
A space before the class name is required. <br>
